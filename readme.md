## Features

This project implements a full JPEG compression pipeline using modern SystemVerilog constructs:

- `logic` data type
- Color space transformation (RGB to YCbCr)
- 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for Y, Cb, Cr
- Fixed-point quantization with precomputed reciprocals
- Huffman encoding for each 8×8 block
- FF byte-stuffing and bitstream output
