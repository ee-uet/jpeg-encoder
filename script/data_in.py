# Description:
# This Python script converts an RGB image (specifically resized to 96Ã—96 pixels) into a SystemVerilog-compatible stimulus file
# by extracting the red, green, and blue values of each pixel and formatting them as 24-bit binary values, where blue occupies bits [23:16], green [15:8], 
# and red [7:0]. Each line in the output file assigns a pixel to the data_in signal in the format data_in <= 24'b...; followed by a delay (#10000;),
# making it suitable for use in a Verilog or SystemVerilog testbench for simulating an image-processing module like a JPEG encoder.
